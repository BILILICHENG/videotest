This library is used to store videos. It has no function. The purpose of its existence is to allow other libraries to call it.

In short, you should not access this library. There is nothing you want here.

//

This library exists to adapt to the Test 3 project. Since the storage size of this library is constantly increasing, I don't like it! Therefore, when the storage capacity of this library is about 2gb, I will further compress the quality of the video, or delete the entire library directly.

At present, I don't mind showing these files directly to everyone, but when necessary, I will delete the entire library because I think the Github team may hate my library because it takes up too much storage space and network, and there are no script files...
